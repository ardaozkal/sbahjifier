# sbahjifier
Image manipulator to make images more Hella and Sweet. If you have to ask what this does, it is almost certainly not the tool you're looking for.

Processes images and attempts to make them resemble something that might appear in [Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/sweetbroandhellajeff/) (probably nsfw).

## Installation

- This only supports python2. So install that. 

- Also, it uses PIL. (hint: `pip2 install Pillow`).

## Usage

If you run it on its own, it'll just convert stuff from `/src/` and output to `/dest/`. If you supply it command line arguments, it'll sbahjify those. How cool is that?
