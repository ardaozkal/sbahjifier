# sbahjifier

Image manipulator to make images more Hella and Sweet. If you have to ask what this does, it is almost certainly not the tool you're looking for.

## Notice: Moved

Due to various reasons (one of them being Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub), I'm moving this project to Gitlab.

I plan maintain this project, to at least keep it up to date with newest versions of Python 3.

You can access the new repo [here](https://gitlab.com/aoz/sbahjifier).

## Original text:

Processes images and attempts to make them resemble something that might appear in [Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/sweetbroandhellajeff/) (probably nsfw).

## Installation

- This only supports python3. So install that. 

- Also, it uses PIL. (`pip3 install Pillow`).

## Usage

If you run it on its own, it'll just convert stuff from `/src/` and output to `/dest/`. If you supply it command line arguments, it'll sbahjify those. How cool is that?
